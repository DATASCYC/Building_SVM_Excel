### About the Project

#### Project Title:
Building Support Vector Machine Using Microsoft Excel for Predicting Heart Disease

#### Overview:
This project focuses on developing and optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model using Microsoft Excel to aid in the early diagnosis of heart disease. With the rising number of patients experiencing heart-related issues, timely and accurate diagnosis is critical. The application of machine learning techniques, particularly SVMs, can significantly enhance the diagnostic process, reducing the burden on healthcare professionals and ensuring better patient outcomes.

#### Objectives:
- **Develop SVM Models:** Create multiple SVM models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient data.
- **Optimize Performance:** Identify and select the optimal SVM model by comparing various models and their performance metrics.
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** Perform sensitivity analysis on model parameters to understand their impact on model accuracy and reliability.
- **Evaluate Advantages and Limitations:** Assess the benefits and limitations of the developed SVM models in a practical healthcare setting.

### Key Findings and Impact

#### Model Generation and Improvement:
- **Initial Models:** Three SVM models were developed using patient data that included age, maximal heart rate, cholesterol level, and resting blood pressure.
- **Improvement Steps:** The models were refined by incorporating an error tolerance parameter (位) to handle potential misclassifications and improve robustness.

#### Model Assessment and Comparison:
- **Accuracy Metrics:** The models were evaluated based on their accuracy in predicting heart disease in training and test datasets.
- **Optimal Model Selection:** Among the developed models, SVM3 emerged as the optimal choice, demonstrating superior performance in handling partial data and providing reliable predictions.

#### Sensitivity Analysis:
- **Impact of 位 Parameter:** It was observed that increasing 位 improved the model's performance on the test set but reduced accuracy on the training set. This highlights the trade-off between overfitting and generalization.
- **Decision Variable Insights:** Age and cholesterol level were identified as significant factors in the prediction model, aligning with medical expertise.

#### Advantages:
- **Enhanced Decision-Making:** SVM models provide high prediction accuracy, aiding healthcare professionals in making informed decisions quickly and efficiently.
- **Resource Optimization:** By reducing manual data processing efforts, resources can be redirected to critical areas in healthcare, such as technology upgrades and service improvements.

#### Limitations:
- **Model Constraints:** The optimal 位 value and model performance are influenced by the size and quality of the training and testing datasets. Larger datasets could improve model reliability.
- **False Positives:** SVM3 shows a slight tendency towards false positive diagnoses, indicating a need for further refinement to balance sensitivity and specificity.

### Impact on Healthcare:
The implementation of SVM models in predicting heart disease can revolutionize diagnostic practices, enabling early and accurate detection. This not only alleviates the burden on healthcare providers but also enhances patient care by facilitating timely intervention. The project's findings underscore the potential of integrating machine learning into medical diagnostics, paving the way for future advancements and research in this field.
